SF weather is all about layers - you might be warm in the sunny Mission District but freezing 20 minutes later in windy Marina!\n\nIf you're planning to be out late (temps will drop) or spending time by the water, definitely bring that hoodie. You'll see plenty of locals in the hoodie + jeans combo year-round. 👌",

Federal EV Charging Program Funding Resumes After Trump Administration Freeze\n\nDollars from the $5 billion infrastructure program that Joe Biden's White House crafted to speed EV adoption are flowing again after the Trump Administration froze the funds at the start of this year. In June, a federal court overturned the suspension and states hustled to revamp their charging plans. This development is significant for EV charging companies that are now able to access federal funding to expand charging station networks across the United States.\n\n## 2. Oregon Launches Second Round of NEVI Funding for Fast-Charging Expansion\n\nOregon is hoping to add at least 200 public fast-charging electric vehicle chargers on some of the state's major highways by the end of next year, with the state seeking applications from companies that will build and maintain the charging stations. The Oregon Department of Transportation recently opened up its second round funding through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, which aims to build out a network of public DC fast chargers that can take an electric vehicle from zero to 80% charged in about 20 minutes, with Oregon set to receive more than $52 million over a period of five years through the program.\n\nBoth stories highlight ongoing efforts to expand EV charging infrastructure in the United States through federal funding programs, particularly after overcoming earlier administrative obstacles.",
