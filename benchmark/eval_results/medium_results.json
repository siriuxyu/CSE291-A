The text is explaining that the benefits of print become particularly obvious or noticeable when tasks involve mental abstraction.\n\n**The answer is (D) Become easy to notice.**\n\nThe phrase \"shine through\" means to become clearly visible or evident.

However, the key word is \"However\" - this signals an important qualification. The author then warns that educators shouldn't assume all media are equal, especially when the goal is \"maximizing learning.\"\n\nCombined with the earlier evidence in the passage showing that \"learning is generally more successful when it's on paper\" for longer texts and complex tasks, the implication is clear.\n\n**The answer is (C) Print texts cannot be entirely replaced in education.**\n\nThe author is implying that while digital media have their uses, they cannot completely replace print texts because different media have different strengths and weaknesses. Since print has been shown to be superior for certain types of learning (particularly complex tasks requiring mental abstraction), educators need to continue using print alongside digital media rather than replacing it entirely.\n\nThe other options are not supported:\n- (A) \"multiple learning techniques\" - the passage is specifically about media formats, not learning techniques\n- (B) about producing materials - not mentioned or implied\n- (D) about education outside the classroom - not discussed in the passage",
