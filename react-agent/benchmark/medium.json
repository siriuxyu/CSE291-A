The reasons relate to... reduced concentration... When reading texts of several hundred words or more, learning is generally more successful when it's on paper... The benefits of print reading particularly shine through when experimenters move from... simple tasks... to ones that require mental abstraction... The differences... relate to paper's physical properties... People often link their memory... to how far into the book... But equally important is the mental aspect... 'shallowing hypothesis.' According to this theory, people approach digital texts with a mindset suited to social media... and devote less mental effort... Audio and video can feel more engaging... psychologists have demonstrated that when adults read news stories, they remember more... Digital texts, audio and video all have educational roles... However, for maximizing learning... educators shouldn't assume all media are the same... [Text End]. Now, Q1: What does the underlined phrase 'shine through' in paragraph 2 mean? (A) Seem unlikely to last. (B) Seem hard to explain. (C) Become ready to use. (D) Become easy to notice."
